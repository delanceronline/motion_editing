# Synethsis of MoCap Motion

## Motion capture seems to be an ideal solution to bring realistic and natural motion into a digital form.  However,  motion captured data lacks flexibility and is very difficult to be edited without degrading its quality.  MotionEditing is a tool to make new motions from the existing MoCap motions.  It treats the motions as signals and processes it through different binary operations: Motion Blending, Motion Concatenation, Motion Exaggeration, Motion Extraction, Motion Substitution and Motion Warping.

## "MotionEditing" was a tool working with the Multimedia Innovative Centre in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.  It is for editing motions from MoCap system and supports six operations: Motion Blending, Motion Concatenation, Motion Exaggeration, Motion Extraction, Motion Substitution and Motion Warping.
